# ShellProgramming
The Mav Shell (msh), like the Bourne Shell (bash), the C-shell (csh), or the Korn Shell (ksh), accepts commands, forks a child process, and executes them. As soon as the program is ready to accept input, it will print out msh>. Upon receiving a supported shell command, it shall execute and display the output. The shell will print ": Command not found" if the command is invalid. The shell will exit with status zero if the command is "quit" or "exit". In the event that the user types a blank line, the shell will quietly print another prompt and accept a new line of input. 
The version of Mav shell will support up to 10 command line parameters in addition to the command. The shell supports and executes any command entered. Any command in /bin, /usr/bin/, /usr/local/bin/ and the current working directory is to be considered valid for testing. The shell searchs the following PATH at minimum: 1. Current working directory, 2. /usr/local/bin 3. /usr/bin 4. /bin
